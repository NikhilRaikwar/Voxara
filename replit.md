# Voxara

A music-driven language and pronunciation tutor. Search by song or remembered lyric, discover music by mood or breakout momentum, then learn in **Listen mode** and rehearse in **Practice mode** with model pronunciation and word-by-word grading. Uploading audio is optional; a bundled, rights-clear demo runs end to end without an upload.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/web run dev` — run the web frontend
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- Required secrets: `MUSIXMATCH_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `SONGSTATS_API_KEY` (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` powers TTS model pronunciation, optional vocal isolation, and pronunciation grading)
- Translation uses the Replit-managed OpenAI integration: `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5, multer (in-memory file uploads)
- Frontend: React + Vite, wouter, TanStack Query, cream/terracotta theme
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`); API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **No database** — Musixmatch terms prohibit caching lyrics, so all session state is client-side.

## Where things live

- API contract: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` → generates `lib/api-client-react` (hooks) and `lib/api-zod` (schemas)
- Server routes: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` (`tracks.ts`, `isolation.ts`, `grade.ts`)
- Provider clients: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/` (`musixmatch.ts`, `elevenlabs.ts` (isolation + STT), `translate.ts`, `grading.ts`, `songstats.ts`)
- Popularity stats UI: `artifacts/web/src/components/TrackCard.tsx` (lazy per-card stats); Trending section: `artifacts/web/src/pages/Landing.tsx`
- Central error handler: `artifacts/api-server/src/app.ts`
- Frontend pages: `artifacts/web/src/pages/`; raw-fetch upload calls: `artifacts/web/src/lib/api-extra.ts`
- Zero-upload demo: `artifacts/web/src/data/demoTrack.ts` + `artifacts/web/public/demo/frere-jacques.mp3`; reproducible generator: `artifacts/web/scripts/generate-demo-audio.mjs`

## Architecture decisions

- **File-upload endpoints (`POST /isolation`, `POST /grade`) are NOT in the OpenAPI spec.** They are called via raw `fetch` + `FormData` from `api-extra.ts`. Putting multipart in the spec produced File/Blob codegen errors, and mixing path+query params on one op caused name collisions. All other endpoints are query-param-only and generate clean hooks.
- **Translation is done by an LLM, not Musixmatch.** The Musixmatch plan in use returns the original text for `subtitle_translated` and 0 results for `lyrics.translation.get`, so `translate.ts` batch-translates lyric lines via the OpenAI integration (`gpt-5-mini` with `reasoning_effort: minimal`, falling back to `gpt-4.1-mini`).
- **Vocal isolation uses ElevenLabs Audio Isolation (`POST /v1/audio-isolation`), and is synchronous.** Unlike the old LALAL flow (upload→split→poll), ElevenLabs returns the isolated vocal bytes in one call. So `POST /api/isolation` runs isolation inline and streams the `audio/mpeg` result straight back; the frontend plays it from an in-memory `URL.createObjectURL` blob. There is no job id, no status endpoint, and no polling. (LALAL was removed because its free-tier key cannot do stem splits.)
- **External account-limit errors map to 4xx, not 5xx.** The central handler masks all 5xx as a generic message. ElevenLabs quota/auth failures (401/402/403/429) are classified as `402` so their actionable message reaches the user via `api-extra.ts`.
- Generated react-query hooks require `queryKey` in the options object (TanStack v5 + Orval 8). Call sites pass the generated `getXQueryKey(...)` helper alongside `enabled`.
- **Popularity stats come from Songstats, matched by track name + artist.** `GET /tracks/stats` chains Songstats `tracks/search` → `tracks/stats` (this key has no ISRC on Musixmatch tracks). Stats are non-critical enrichment: failures degrade to `{found:false}` (hidden on the card) rather than erroring. `songstats.ts` retries 429/5xx with backoff and caches results in-memory (10 min) — this caches popularity stats only, never Musixmatch lyrics, so the no-cache rule is unaffected.
- **Trending uses Musixmatch `chart.tracks.get`, not Songstats.** Songstats charts endpoints return 403 on this key, so `GET /tracks/trending` returns the Musixmatch top chart; each card then enriches via the stats endpoint.
- **Per-line model pronunciation uses ElevenLabs TTS, not the isolated vocal.** `GET /tracks/:trackId/lines/:index/audio` (`routes/lineAudio.ts`) derives the line text server-side (richsync→subtitles) and streams synthesized `audio/mpeg` via `synthesizeLine()` in `lib/elevenlabs.ts` (model `eleven_multilingual_v2`, default voice `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`). It is **off the OpenAPI spec** (path+query params) and called via `<audio>`/`lineAudioUrl()` in `api-extra.ts`; rate-limited by `ttsLimiter` (40/15min); `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- **"I remember a lyric" search uses Musixmatch `track.search` with `q_lyrics`.** `identifyByLyric()` → `GET /tracks/identify?lyric=` (operationId `identifyTrack`, query-param-only so it IS in the spec). TrackSearch has a song/lyric mode toggle.
- **"Discover by mood" maps fixed moods → lyric keyword queries.** `discoverByMood()` (server-side `MOOD_QUERIES` allowlist) → `GET /tracks/discover?mood=` (enum-validated; in the spec). Surfaces results on Landing via `TrackCard`. Lyric-powered recommendations, driven by what songs _say_ (`q` full-text), not titles.
- **"Breakout Tracks" re-ranks the Musixmatch chart by a Songstats velocity score.** `getTrackVelocity()` derives momentum from Songstats `_current` vs `_total` counters + live `charts_current` (Shazam weighted highest) + fresh editorial-playlist share; `GET /tracks/breakout` (returns `BreakoutTrack[]` with `velocityScore`). Velocity is non-critical: a failed lookup degrades to score 0 (sinks to bottom). Has its own 10-min velocity cache, separate from the stats cache.
- **The zero-upload demo is a client-side sentinel track, not persisted provider content.** Track id `-1` selects a bundled `TrackSession` for the public-domain “Frère Jacques” text plus an ElevenLabs-synthesized MP3 and character-alignment-derived word timings. Landing clears the prior session before selecting it; Listen and Practice disable the normal track-session request and use the bundled session/audio. Practice clips the shared MP3 to the active line, while learner grading still uses the normal live ElevenLabs STT route. Re-running `generate-demo-audio.mjs` requires `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, consumes provider credits, and overwrites both generated assets.

## Gotchas

- **ElevenLabs Audio Isolation rejects clips shorter than ~4.6 seconds** (`audio_too_short`) and consumes ElevenLabs credits per call. Isolation runs synchronously and can take up to ~a minute for a full song — keep the request timeout generous and show a loading state.
- Verify artifacts with `pnpm --filter @workspace/<slug> run typecheck`, not `build` (build needs workflow-provided `PORT`/`BASE_PATH`).
- Do not change the OpenAPI `info.title` — it controls generated filenames.
- ElevenLabs STT model is `scribe_v1`; grade field names are `file`, `expected`, `language_code`. Our `/api/isolation` upload field is `file`, but the ElevenLabs Audio Isolation API itself expects the multipart field name `audio`.
